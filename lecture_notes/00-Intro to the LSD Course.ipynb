    "or alternatively install Git on Windows and follow the directions: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16247703\n",
    "    * On Unix'ish operating systems, if you did not already generate an SSH keypair, generate one (e.g., via `ssh-keygen -t rsa`)\n",
    "  * Clone this repository into a directory of your choice (`/path/to/`):\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd ./soft2017fall-lsd-teaching-material/vm\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * Subsequently, start up the VM, which will take a bit on the first start up as it has to download the Ubuntu image and a bit of other software.\n",

    "    vagrant up\n",

    "   \n",

That is, the server is always started in the scope of the current directory. When you have your notebooks stored in another directory than the one in which you execute `notebook`, then you have change directories before.\n",
