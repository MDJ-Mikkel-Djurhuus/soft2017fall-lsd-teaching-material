    "    * To get started with Vagrant on Windows, see https://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/ Focus in particular on using PuTTY instead of SSH on Windows\n",
    "or alternatively install Git on Windows and follow the directions: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16247703\n",
    "    * On Unix'ish operating systems, if you did not already generate an SSH keypair, generate one (e.g., via `ssh-keygen -t rsa`)\n",
    "  * Clone this repository into a directory of your choice (`/path/to/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/datsoftlyngby/soft2017fall-lsd-teaching-material.git \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On the command line change directory to where you cloned this repository (`/path/to/cloned/repo/vm`). Likely, it is just:\n",

    "    ```bash\n",
    "    cd ./soft2017fall-lsd-teaching-material/vm\n",
    "    ```\n",

    "    vagrant up\n",

    "  * To log onto the virtual machine (VM) execute\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    vagrant ssh\n",

    "    **Note** The `notebook` command is just an alias to the complete command `jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --NotebookApp.token=\"\"` The `notebook` command is context sensitive. That is, the server is always started in the scope of the current directory. When you have your notebooks stored in another directory than the one in which you execute `notebook`, then you have change directories before.\n",
    "    \n",
